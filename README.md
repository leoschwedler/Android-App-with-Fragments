# Android App with Fragments 📱

## 🌟 Overview
This practical project aims to explore and learn about the use of fragments in Android app development. Fragments are modular components that facilitate the organization and reuse of user interfaces across different screens and orientations.

## 🛠️ Project Structure
The project includes a `MainActivity` that utilizes the `FragmentManager` to manage navigation between different fragments. Each fragment is designed to represent a specific part of the user interface.

### Key Components

1. **MainActivity**:
   - Initializes the app and controls navigation between fragments.
   - Uses the `FragmentManager` to manage fragment transactions, such as addition, replacement, and removal.

2. **Fragments**:
   - Each fragment (e.g., `ExampleFragment`) is a modular unit of the user interface.
   - Inflates a custom layout (`fragment_example.xml`) and may contain presentation logic and user interaction.

## 🚀 Implemented Features
The project demonstrates basic functionalities, including:

- Dynamically adding fragments to the layout using `FragmentManager`.
- Using `FragmentTransaction` to handle fragment transactions.
- Managing the `BackStack` to support back navigation between fragments.

## 📚 Study Objectives
This project aims to provide practical understanding of using fragments in Android app development. By completing this study, the goal is to gain proficiency in:

- Creating flexible and adaptable user interfaces using fragments.
- Effectively using `FragmentManager` to manage fragment dynamics.
- Implementing intuitive navigation between different parts of the app.
